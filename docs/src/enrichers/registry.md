# Registry-metadata enrichers (npm / PyPI / crates.io)

bomdrift queries package registries for each newly-added component
(plus npm version-changed components for the maintainer-set check)
and surfaces three kinds of finding:

- **Recently published** — the publish timestamp is within
  `--recently-published-days` (default 14 days). Recent publishes
  correlate with takeover swaps and namespace-reuse attacks.
- **Deprecated** — the package or version is flagged deprecated on
  npm, yanked on PyPI / crates.io, or carries an "Inactive" PyPI
  classifier.
- **Maintainer set changed (npm only)** — the maintainer set listed
  for the new version differs from the maintainer set listed for the
  old version. Classic xz / Jia Tan precursor.

## Sources

| Ecosystem | URL | Headers |
|---|---|---|
| npm | `https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>` (URL-encoded `@scope/name`) | `User-Agent: bomdrift/<version>` |
| PyPI | `https://pypi.org/pypi/<pkg>/json` | — |
| crates.io | `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<name>` | `User-Agent: bomdrift/0.9.0 (https://github.com/Metbcy/bomdrift)` (required by crates.io) |

## Disk cache

Per ecosystem under `<XDG_CACHE>/bomdrift/registry/<eco>/<pkg>.json`,
24-hour TTL, atomic temp-file + rename writes. Mirrors the OSV / EPSS
/ KEV cache shape.

## Best-effort

A registry timeout, parse error, or unsupported ecosystem returns
`Ok` with no findings. Diff rendering NEVER blocks on registry
responses.

## Calibration

- `--recently-published-days <N>` — override the default 14-day
  threshold. Set `--recently-published-days 0` to disable that check
  while keeping deprecation / maintainer-set-changed.
- `--cache-ttl-hours <N>` (v0.9.6+) — overrides the default 24h disk
  cache TTL for the per-ecosystem registry caches.

## Disabling

```bash
bomdrift diff before.json after.json --no-registry
```

Disables all three checks at once. Equivalent to `[diff] no_registry =
true` in `.bomdrift.toml`.

## Flags

- `--no-registry` — skip all three checks.
- `--recently-published-days <N>` — see [Calibration](#calibration).
- `--fail-on recently-published`, `--fail-on deprecated` — exit-2
  thresholds.

## Output

- **Markdown**: three new sections — "Recently published",
  "Deprecated upstream", "Maintainer set changed (npm)" — in the
  per-category area.
- **JSON**: `enrichment.recently_published`,
  `enrichment.deprecated`, `enrichment.maintainer_set_changed`.
- **SARIF**: rules `bomdrift.recently-published`,
  `bomdrift.deprecated`, `bomdrift.maintainer-set-changed` with
  stable `partialFingerprints.primaryHash/v1`.
- **Calibration** rows (`--debug-calibration`):
  `recently-published|<purl>|<days>|14`,
  `deprecated|<purl>|<message>|any`,
  `maintainer-set-changed|<purl>|<changes>|1`.

## Why npm-only for maintainer-set-changed?

PyPI and crates.io don't expose a clean "maintainers per version"
view in their public REST API:

- **PyPI**: the `info.maintainer` and `info.author` fields are
  free-text and inconsistent across releases. There's no historical
  record per release.
- **crates.io**: `owners` is package-level, not version-level, so we
  can't tell which owners had publish rights at the time of an
  individual version.

When the upstream APIs gain a per-version maintainer view we'll
extend the enricher; a future-version follow-up.
