# EPSS

bomdrift queries the [Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)] from
FIRST.org for every CVE-aliased advisory and surfaces the per-CVE score
(0.0 – 1.0) in markdown / terminal / SARIF output.

EPSS estimates the probability that a given CVE will be exploited in the
next 30 days. Combined with severity it gives reviewers a sharper signal
than CVSS alone — a Critical CVE with EPSS 0.01 is far less urgent than a
Medium CVE with EPSS 0.85.

## Output

- **Markdown**: per-advisory badge `EPSS 0.87` after the severity label.
- **Terminal**: same badge, no markup.
- **JSON**: `enrichment.vulns[purl][i].epss_score` numeric field.
- **SARIF**: `properties.epssScore` on `bomdrift.cve` results.

When an advisory is keyed by GHSA but has CVE aliases, the score is the
**max across all CVE aliases** so a GHSA covering two CVEs surfaces the
worse of the two.

## Threshold gating

```bash
bomdrift diff before.json after.json --fail-on-epss 0.5
```

Exits 2 when any advisory has score ≥ 0.5. 0.5 is roughly the top decile
of actively-exploited CVEs; tune for your team's risk appetite.

## Calibration

- `--cache-ttl-hours <N>` (v0.9.6+) — overrides the default 24h disk
  cache TTL for the EPSS scores cache.
- `--fail-on-epss <FLOAT>` — threshold gate; see [Threshold gating](#threshold-gating).

## Disabling

```bash
bomdrift diff before.json after.json --no-epss
```

or in `.bomdrift.toml`:

```toml
[diff]
no_epss = true
```

Both forms skip the FIRST.org HTTP call AND the disk cache lookup.

## Caching

24h TTL at `<XDG_CACHE>/bomdrift/epss/<cve>.json`. Negative results
(CVEs FIRST.org returned no score for) are cached to avoid re-querying
recently-published CVEs that haven't been scored yet.

## Best-effort

Like every bomdrift enricher, EPSS is best-effort: a network failure or
a malformed response surfaces a `BOMDRIFT_DEBUG=1` stderr note and the
diff renders with empty `epss_score` fields. EPSS being unreachable is
never a reason to block a PR review.
