# Typosquat detection

The typosquat enricher flags newly added components whose names are
suspiciously close to a popular package in the same ecosystem. v0.4 covers
**npm**, **PyPI**, **Cargo**, **Maven**, **Go**, **RubyGems**, **NuGet**,
and **Composer** with rules tuned per ecosystem.

## The signal

Typosquatting is a real and recurring supply-chain attack pattern:

- The 2024 PyPI campaign that registered `colorama-0.4.7` — note the
  trailing zero — to drop a credential stealer.
- The Mar 2026 axios incident's `plain-crypto-js@4.2.1` — a typo of the
  legitimate `crypto-js` — used to exfiltrate via WAVESHAPER.V2.
- Sustained npm `lodash` lookalikes (`loadash`, `loadsh`, `loadshes`)
  through 2024–2026.

The pattern is consistent across ecosystems: a candidate name with high
visual / phonetic similarity to a popular package, often with a single
character substitution / insertion / deletion, sometimes with an added
prefix or suffix. The defender's task is to flag the candidate at PR
review time, before `npm install` or `pip install` runs the malicious
code.

## Algorithm

The core scoring is **Jaro-Winkler similarity** with a **suffix-containment
boost** for the textbook prefix-add pattern (`plain-crypto-js`).
Threshold: **0.92** for a finding to surface. Maven is the exception (see
below).

### Per-ecosystem rules

| Ecosystem | Canonicalization | Separators | Scoring |
|---|---|---|---|
| npm | lowercase | `-`, `_`, `.`, `/` | Jaro-Winkler + suffix boost |
| PyPI | PEP 503 (lowercase, `-`/`_`/`.` collapse) | `-`, `_`, `.` | Jaro-Winkler + suffix boost |
| Cargo | lowercase | `-` | Jaro-Winkler + suffix boost |
| Maven | lowercase | (n/a) | Levenshtein ≤ 2 on `artifactId` only |
| Go | lowercase | `-`, `/` | Jaro-Winkler on **last path segment** |
| Gem | lowercase | `-`, `_` | Jaro-Winkler + suffix boost |
| NuGet | lowercase (case-insensitive per spec) | `.` | Jaro-Winkler + suffix boost |
| Composer | lowercase | `-`, `/` | Jaro-Winkler on **package portion** |

#### Filtering rules (npm / PyPI / Cargo)

1. **Exact match (case-insensitive after canonicalization) → skip.** The
   candidate IS a popular package, not a squat.
2. **Likely-legit ecosystem extension → skip.** When the candidate
   starts with the legit name followed by a separator, this matches
   the well-established convention for extension packages
   (`react-router`, `axios-retry`, `eslint-plugin-react`,
   `pytest-asyncio`). The structural rule is keyed on ecosystem-
   specific separator sets so PyPI's `-`/`_`/`.` interchange doesn't
   leak into npm's wider set.
3. **Suffix containment with a substantial added prefix → boost.** When
   the candidate ends with the legit name (length ≥ 5) AND the added
   prefix is longer than 3 characters, the score is boosted to at
   least 0.95. This catches the deceptive `plain-crypto-js` pattern
   that pure JW alone misses (the long prefix kills base similarity).
4. **Otherwise: plain Jaro-Winkler.** Threshold 0.92 catches single-
   character drift like `cross-env → crossenv` (~0.98) or
   `express → expresss` (~0.97), while `react → react-router`
   (~0.88) stays below the threshold.

#### Match-form rules (Go and Composer)

Go and Composer share an additional structural rule: the user-visible
coordinate has a stable, long prefix (Go's `host/owner/`, Composer's
`vendor/`) that's duplicated across many legitimate packages. Including
the prefix in Jaro-Winkler scoring would inflate similarity past
anything useful — every Spring artifact would score 0.95+ against every
other Spring artifact, every Symfony package against every other
Symfony package.

Both ecosystems extract a **match form** from the canonicalized
coordinate before scoring:

- **Go**: the **last path segment** of `host/owner/repo` (e.g.
  `github.com/spf13/cobra` → `cobra`).
- **Composer**: the **package portion** of `vendor/package` (e.g.
  `symfony/console` → `console`).

Comparison happens on match forms. When two distinct full coordinates
collapse to the same match form (`github.com/spf13/cobra` and
`github.com/myorg/cobra`), they're treated as legitimate forks and
**not flagged**. Only typo'd match forms (`cobraa` vs `cobra`) trip the
JW similarity threshold.

#### Maven rules

Maven coordinates are `groupId:artifactId`. The shared `groupId` prefix
is often very long (`org.springframework.boot:`,
`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:`) and would inflate Jaro-Winkler past
anything useful — every Spring artifact would score 0.95+ against
every other Spring artifact. The Maven path skips JW + suffix-
containment entirely and uses **Levenshtein distance ≤ 2 on the
`artifactId` portion** only.

`commons-lng3` differs from `commons-lang3` by Levenshtein 1
(insert `a`), so it fires regardless of whether the `groupId` matches.
A different-`groupId` republish of an exact `commons-lang3` artifact
does **not** fire — that's a legitimate fork / republish, not a typo.

## Reputational care

The renderer wording is intentional:

> *X is similar to Y*

— never *X is a typosquat of Y*. Flagging a legitimate package as a
malicious squat in a public PR comment is real reputational harm to
the package author. The structural similarity is observable; intent
is not. The human reviewing the PR is the analyst making the
determination.

The CLI / Action exit code reflects this: typosquat findings are
always informational. `--fail-on typosquat` exists for projects that
want to gate on the structural signal explicitly, but it's never the
default.

## Reference lists

Embedded snapshots ship in the binary:

| File | Source | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `data/npm-top1k.txt` | [anvaka/npmrank](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491) | 1000 |
| `data/pypi-top200.txt` | [hugovk/top-pypi-packages](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/) | 200 |
| `data/cargo-top200.txt` | crates.io API `?sort=downloads` | 200 |
| `data/maven-top100.txt` | mvnrepository.com Most Popular (curated) | ~100 |
| `data/go-top200.txt` | pkg.go.dev + awesome-go (curated) | ~180 |
| `data/gem-top200.txt` | rubygems.org popular gems (curated) | ~245 |
| `data/nuget-top200.txt` | nuget.org v3 search API `?orderby=totalDownloads` | 200 |
| `data/composer-top200.txt` | packagist.org popular categories (curated) | ~190 |

v0.7 expanded the curated Go, Composer, and Gem lists — the
ship-with-binary snapshots now cover the CNCF / HashiCorp / gRPC-
ecosystem corners of Go, the Symfony / Laravel / Doctrine /
testing / Packagist-popular tail of Composer, and the Rails /
dry-rb / serializer / search corners of RubyGems. Each top-up is
grouped under a `# --- v0.7 top-up: <category> (source: ...) ---`
header in the data file so future curators can see provenance.

Lists are intentionally smaller than `npm-top1k.txt` for the multi-
ecosystem ships (v0.2 + v0.4): the algorithm is identical across
ecosystems, so a smaller seed still proves the signal end-to-end. Lists
grow in subsequent releases without code changes — only the embedded
snapshot does.

### Refreshing

```bash
bomdrift refresh-typosquat                    # all eight ecosystems
bomdrift refresh-typosquat --ecosystem npm
bomdrift refresh-typosquat --ecosystem pypi
bomdrift refresh-typosquat --ecosystem cargo
bomdrift refresh-typosquat --ecosystem nuget
```

Refreshed lists are written to
`<XDG_CACHE_HOME>/bomdrift/typosquat/<ecosystem>.txt` via temp-file +
atomic rename. The enricher prefers cache files over the embedded
snapshot when present and parseable.

`--ecosystem maven|go|gem|composer` are accepted but emit a notice:
Maven Central, pkg.go.dev, RubyGems, and Packagist all lack stable
public popularity feeds (or have had ones that went through breaking
changes). The curated lists shipped in the binary remain the source
of truth; refreshing those means editing `data/<eco>-top*.txt` and
rebuilding bomdrift. PRs adding names to the curated lists are
welcome.

## Calibration

### `--typosquat-similarity-threshold <FLOAT>` (v0.9.6+)

Default `0.92`, range `[0.0, 1.0]`. Configurable via CLI flag or
`[diff] typosquat_similarity_threshold = <float>` in `.bomdrift.toml`.

The threshold applies to the JW + suffix-boost path (npm, PyPI, Cargo,
RubyGems, NuGet, Go, Composer). The Maven Levenshtein-≤-2 path is
hardcoded — Levenshtein distance and JW similarity aren't directly
comparable, so a single threshold flag would either over- or
under-suppress on Maven.

Recommended ranges:

- `0.95` — very strict; only catches near-perfect matches. Good for
  tightening down false positives in monorepos with many internally
  forked dependencies.
- `0.92` (default) — calibrated against the top-1000-of-each-ecosystem
  test corpus to produce zero false positives there.
- `0.85` — lenient; catches softer near-misses at the cost of more
  false positives. Useful for paranoid security review of brand-new
  PyPI / npm packages.

The threshold also appears in `--debug-calibration` rows so collected
samples can guide tuning:

```
typosquat|<purl>|<similarity_score>|0.92
```

## False-positive management

The structural rules + thresholds aim for "no false positives on the
top 1000 of each ecosystem." If you discover a false positive in the
wild:

1. Add a regression test in `src/enrich/typosquat.rs::tests` showing
   the false positive doesn't fire.
2. Open a PR. Tightening the rule (rather than special-casing the
   package name) is preferred — drives a cleaner heuristic.

## Disabling

Pure compute, no network. There is no `--no-typosquat` flag — disabling
the typosquat enricher would defeat its primary purpose. To suppress
*specific* false-positive findings, hand-curate a per-component baseline
entry; see [Baseline & suppression — Worked example](../baseline.md#worked-example-triaging-a-false-positive).

To gate exit code on typosquat findings, use `--fail-on typosquat`.
